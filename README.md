# Children's Railway Simulator

:train2::vertical_traffic_light: This software simulates the interlocking systems and the traffic control of the [Children's Railway, Budapest](https://gyermekvasut.hu/en/home/).

:mortar_board::children_crossing: It has been made for educational purposes, to improve the training of ~400 children every year. It was actively used between 2015 and 2020.

:chart_with_upwards_trend::baby: I developed it in 2013-2014 when I was 14-15 years old. At that time, I was absolulety new to programming and had no professional knowledge about software engineering. Some kind people helped me during the development but there were always some issues with the 'product'.

:chart_with_downwards_trend::end: After I left the Children's Railway, there was noone to maintain and operate the program so they stopped using it (this was also the time of COVID, which didn't help the situation, either).

:bulb::rocket: Years later, with some knowledge and experience in software engineering, I decided several times to rewrite the code and make the simulator operate again. But, as always, I never had enough time for it so it is still just a plan. *Who knows what the future might bring...*

### :warning:**DISCLAIMER**:warning:

This source code was written by an unexperienced teenager without real knowledge of OOP for example, not by a professional software engineer so read it as it is. It is full of design errors, code smells, warnings. It is not maintained, and it is absolutely not advisable to use any part of it anywhere.

*It is here mainly for historical purposes.*
